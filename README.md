## Vision

_This project is in a very early stage!_

Purpose of the project is to create a point pattern analysis library. 
Further, a command line interface for point pattern analysis will be provided.

In the future, bindings for use of the library in R and Python are planned.

## Library / crate

To use this crate as a rust library, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies section:
```
ppa = { git = "https://github.com/mlange-42/ppa.git" }
```

_Warning:_ The API is still incomplete and highly unstable, so be prepared for frequent changes. 
Any help to stabilize the API is highly appreciated.

For the latest development version, see branch [`dev`](https://github.com/mlange-42/ppa/tree/dev).
